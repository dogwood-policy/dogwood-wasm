//! The fail-closed rule shared by `replay` and `DogwoodAuthorizer::isAuthorized`.
//!
//! Cedar skips a policy whose condition errors and decides from the rest, and
//! the request context is not validated against the schema. So an argument of
//! the wrong type (or a missing one) read by a `forbid` drops that rule, and a
//! matching `permit` comes back Allow with the error attached. Both entry
//! points pass every decision through [`fail_closed`] so they agree on every
//! event.

/// On errors the verdict becomes [`Verdict::Deny`] and `determining_rules` is
/// cleared: a forced deny was determined by no rule (the rules Cedar reports
/// are the permits it would have allowed on). Without errors, both are left as
/// Cedar decided.
